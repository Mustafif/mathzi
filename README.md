# MathZi 

This is a library fully written in Zig and will be used to provide various mathematical operations and algorithms 
natively. Many of these will be inspired by MATLAB (I'm a math student don't judge me) and another aim is to also 
be able to have it work with C/C++ as well. 

Goals: 
- [ ] Runge-Kutta 4th Order algorithm (ODE Solver) 
- [ ] Euler's Numerical Method (ODE Solver)
- [X] Vec3 Abstraction: `src/vec3.zig`
- [ ] Matrix operations 
- [ ] Binomial Distribution 
- [ ] Normal Distribution 
- [ ] Poisson Distribution 
- [ ] Compound Poisson Distribution 
- [ ] Linear Regression 
- [ ] Incremental Five Moments `Stats` type
